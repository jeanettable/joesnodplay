                We call our show “Environmental” (rather than “Immersive”) because while the audience stays
                in one place, the action takes place 360° around them. It is our greatest hope that our
                audience can be placed on swiveling seating, so that they can choose which action to follow at
                any given time. <br /><br />
                Though there is music and dance, we define our show as a “Musical Play” (rather than a
                “Musical”) because no character onstage sings. We will, however, have a trio of female singers
                as part of our pit, who comment on the action the way a film score would.

                    Getting her start in the music industry, Roni started off strong with credits on the hit soundtrack for the award winning show, Glee. As well as assisting on countless other records and singles for artists like Wyclef Jean, Dropkick Murphys and live performance recordings of Sheryl Crow and David Gray, to name a few. Landing work in the post-production industry, her sound design, ADR, and SFX can be found in films and television shows such as Captain Phillips, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, I, Frankenstein, Iron Man 3, Dexter, The Walking Dead, and Smash, among others. Moving into the trailer industry, she was nominated for an Emmy for Black America MLK: And Still I Rise as well as working on a mini series by Ken Burns called Vietnam and HBO’s The Defiant Ones. Always searching for quality projects that pique her interest, she can be found experimenting with sounds and design from everyday life to create a visioned soundscape. During COVID she wanted to find theater pre-production projects to get her ears on and has been designing for immersive shows, show cases, and workshops. When she’s not immersed in sound, you can probably find her in the woods of upstate New York foraging for mushrooms, in the woodshop bending ply, or searching for the best donut this side of The Miss (Voodoo has the trophy for West Coast).<br />

              The project began in 2018, when Ashley and Greer were discussing their chagrin at the lack of originality among new theatrical projects. It seemed to them that very few risks were being taken, and they were also frustrated by the fact that even in an industry overrun with female representation, they seldom got to interact with other female creatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              That day, they set out to make a show that excited them, and was representative of the kind of theater that they wanted to see.

            <em>By Ashley Marinelli</em><br/>
            Several years ago, I read a book that mentioned how much fun Edgar
            Allan Poe was at parties. How he loved to make people laugh, and
            never passed up the opportunity for a practical joke. This did not
            seem like the dark and brooding Edgar Allan Poe I had read about in
            school, and I wondered what else I had been missing. So I went
            digging through the historical record, and I was shocked by what I
            found.<br />
            What struck me most, however, is the amount of women involved in
            Poe’s story. Smart, capable women who, even when they are
            mentioned in the historical record, are painted as mere accessories
            to Poe’s genius, rather than fully realized people in their own right,
            with their own significant contributions to history.<br />
            That got me thinking.<br />
            I wanted to offer a new perspective on the mostly male-tended
            historical record; I wondered what this story would look like if
            we put it through a female lens. So, I gathered an all-female
            team and we started creating. What has come out the other side
            has surprised us all, and made us question the way history comes
            down to us in the first place.<br />
            Though our characters lived on the east coast of the USA during the
            mid-19th century, they feel incredibly contemporary, especially in
            their individual quests for early American celebrity, their polarized
            political opinions, and their struggles with mental health. Though we
            think of these as modern problems, they aren’t at all. The roots go
            way back to the days before our country ever experienced a Civil
            War, and probably way before.<br />

            With Projection Mapping technology finally able to create the optical illusion of performers morphing in real time, and scenery growing and changing around our eyes, it is the perfect time to adapt this story about truth and lies, fiction and non-fiction, fact and fancy. <br />
            With the help of these new methodologies, we are able to create magical realism in real time, and make our audience question whether they are watching a live or digital performer, and otherwise fool, bewitch and trick the senses, making for a wholly unique and otherworldly theatrical experience.

            This isn't simply goodwill, or performative inclusivity. It's really about using performers' unique abilities and/or differently-abled bodies to enhance our show and challenge us to explore new, and possibly better ways of making creative work. and provide us with a more layered and complex creative process.  <br />
            For example, our show has a series of non-verbal characters which speak a detailed physical language all their own. The idea struck us that, not only would dancers from the Deaf/Hard of Hearing/ASL-using community be particularly suited to help us create this wholly new physical language 
            (complete with grammar, syntax and dialect), but would also be the type of performers that would bring layers of nuance and reality to these characters. Therefore, we are currently working with Deaf community advocate, sign language interpreter and performer Brandon Kazen-Mattox to employ people from the signing community as creative consultants and performers.<br />
